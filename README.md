# ai-marketing-genius

Create an AI Marketing expert that works with brands to create clear brand and product messages. 

The customer onboarding should include the ability to train the model by answering these questions about their brand, 
1. What industry do you work in?
2. What was the problem you saw in your niche that you realised you had the power to solve? 
3. How does your experience help your audience solve their present problem? 
4. What's one part of your journey your audience can benefit from learning about the most? 

Use the answers of these questions and database information about the industry to create brand and product marketing messages for the user.

The platform should have three tabs
1. Brand and product messages
2. Generate Marketing (Facebook ads, email marketing copy, seasonal social media calendar ideas, and viral social media ideas)
3. AI-enhanced Data and Customer Analytics

The platform should connect to Meta Facebook and Instagram pages via the REST API and also Google Adwords accounts. The platform should also connect to Google Analytics.

Create a front-end website with a hero, key features, about us, and CTA.
